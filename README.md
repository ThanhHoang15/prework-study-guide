# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Study Guide was created for myself and fellow boot camp students who were going through the prework to organize and navigate through all the notes and information. It contains notes on the initial learnings and fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. This tool helps as a students guide for students to refer back to as they go through the bootcamp. This project helped me learn how to build a web application using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

To use this Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (MacOS) OR Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from Prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
